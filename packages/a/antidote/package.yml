summary    : Antidote is a Zsh plugin manager made from the ground up thinking about performance.
description: |
    The original Antigen plugin manager was slow. Antibody was written to address this, but was written in Go, not Zsh. Other native Zsh plugin managers caught up on speed, so it was deprecated. But Antibody had some nice features that arenâ€™t in other Zsh plugin managers. So Antidote was created to carry on as the next generation of antigen-like Zsh plugin managers.
